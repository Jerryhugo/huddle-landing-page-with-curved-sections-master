## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

This project thought me how to effectively use bootstrap for smooth responsive design. I also learnt how to add complex background to a section.


### Continued development

To build more beautiful interphases, i have decided to go more in depth into css by learning more about bootstrap and tailwind css. Then will move on to learn react and vue frameworks.


### Useful resources
